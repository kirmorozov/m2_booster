M2 Booster
==========
This extension (mostly) implements Magento 2(c) DataObject or Varien_Object in Magento 1.

Implementation is working via a bit customised [PHP-CPP](http://www.php-cpp.com/). 

I added implementations for `$object->array['propery'] = assignment`.

It operates directly with PHP internals.
